911 Recordings Dataset and Analysis:

This repository contains recordings, metadata, and analysis of over 700 critical and unusual 911 calls. The dataset and associated materials offer a unique opportunity to explore real-world emergency scenarios, making it an excellent resource for public safety dispatchers, researchers, and developers working on machine learning applications or audio analysis.

Project Overview
The recordings, originally compiled by the late Gary Allen (Dispatch Monthly magazine), represent some of the most critical and unusual 911 calls, ranging from airline crashes to life-threatening situations. These calls provide valuable insights into public safety communication, offering an irreplaceable educational and analytical resource.

This repository includes:

Raw Recordings: Uncensored mp3 files of 911 calls. Some recordings begin mid-call, contain multiple calls, or feature censored material.
Metadata: Information such as call dates, locations, outcomes (e.g., deaths, potential deaths, false alarms), and whether the call was citizen-initiated.
Analysis Code: An R Markdown file (911network.Rmd) for data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.
Documentation: Brief descriptions of each recording, sourced from Internet Archive captures of the now-defunct 911 Dispatch website.
Applications
This dataset and accompanying tools are suitable for:

Public Safety Training: Offering second-hand experience for emergency response personnel.
Machine Learning: Ideal for projects focusing on audio analysis, speech recognition, or natural language processing.
Research: Analyzing patterns in emergency calls or studying human response in critical situations.
Dataset Details
Format: MP3 recordings and metadata in CSV format.
Source: Curated from public sources and manually coded for accuracy.
Curated Version: A processed version of the dataset is available for machine learning applications here.
Getting Started
